Project Details
	
Research and development of gaming on the XPR network and launching a gaming ecosystem. 

I’ve 2.5 years in the XPR network ecosystem experiencing ,learning, growing and trying to develop digital skills that would benefit the ecosystem and personal growth. I present an endless runner game packed with interaction with the XPR network. 
The architecture of the XPR network provides opportunity to build games and the digital landscape with frictionless Unreal Engine, XPR network and WebAuth interactions. In other ecosystems these interactions suffer from impedance from Gas and Network finality. 
I have been working on a game demo for the last year in my own time and hardware. This game is an endless runner with the object of the game to travel the furthest distance and collect the most XPR network tokens. 
We have a fully working Demo of this game here
We would like to develop this project further in terms of environment, smart contract development, in game assets, webpage, Unreal Engine/WebAuth plugin. 
Once the game is fully functional, we intend to give the project to existing proton community members to run while we turn our focus to the gaming infrastructure.
We will grow the base marketplace into gaming infrastructure with features for all types of users. Gamers, animators, environment artists etc
This platform will become the go to place for all things gamification. 
The proof of concept has been a big step in this journey.

### Ecosystem Fit
-A game that will used as a research and development project and then used by an existing project to run. 
-Research and development of essential tools to showcase the XPR network gaming potential  
-Facilitators in the use of DLT and smart contract technology within the creative space that will build, share tools and smart contracts for the XPR network community
-Builders of features and functionality to allow the use of DLT, games and smart contracts 
-Experienced Community members of 2.5 years building relationships to help the XPR network
-Gamers from an incredibly young age. 
-We understand the technology and its future capabilities
-There has not been any gaming innovation like this previously 	

> 2. Who is your target audience? 
-Game enthusiast on the network
-Exisitng People in the Web 3 gaming Space
-Investors 
-Game Studios,Creatives & Artists, 3d modellers, animators, UI developers etc

> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? 
-We have been XPR community members for 2.5 years and have worked toward bringing gaming to the ecosystem in that time.
-We are driven by providing the best user experience for gamers 
-We have experience across different chains and working and participating in the ecosystems. We see a gap in XPR network market and entire space for gamer orientated gaming. 
-I have worked to create profiles across other ecosystems as buyers, sellers, creators. This can drive new engagement the wider industry. 
-I have 2 decades experience of digital asset knowledge from other industries. The use of parametric modelling, NFTS, Smart contracts and advancements in DLT technology 
will enable us to create games with the XPR network interactions that innovates the digital landscape in many potential ways.
There is no gaming infrastructure on the XPR network. We have built a fully functioning digital asset marketplace that will form part of this infrastructure that we will bring online in phase 2. 
We want to include the ecosystem in this using both Snip coins and developing tools with the new Blastpad for distribution of digital assets
