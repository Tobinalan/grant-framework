Project Details
Research and development of gaming on the XPR network and launching a gaming ecosystem.
With 2.5 years in the XPR network ecosystem experiencing ,learning, growing and developing digital skills to benefit myself and the XPR Network ecosystem. 
I present an endless runner game packed with interaction with the XPR network. The architecture of the XPR network provides opportunity to build games and the digital landscape with frictionless Unreal Engine, XPR network and WebAuth interactions. In other ecosystems these interactions suffer from impedance from Gas and Network finality. I have been working on a game demo for the last year in my own time and hardware. This game is an endless runner with the object of the game to travel the furthest distance and collect the most XPR network tokens. We have a fully working Demo of this game here We would like to develop this project further in terms of environment, smart contract development, in game assets, webpage, Unreal Engine/WebAuth plugin. Once the game is fully functional, we intend to give the project to existing proton community members to run while we turn our focus to the gaming infrastructure. 

How do we Fit the Ecosystem?

-A game that will used as a research and development project and then used by an existing project to run. -Research and development of essential tools to showcase the XPR network gaming potential
-Facilitators in the use of DLT and smart contract technology within the creative space that will build, share tools and smart contracts for the XPR network community 
-Builders of features and functionality to allow the use of DLT, games and smart contracts 
-Experienced Community members of 2.5 years building relationships to help the XPR network -Gamers from an incredibly young age. 
-We understand the technology and its future capabilities -There has not been any gaming innovation like this previously

Who is your target audience? 

-Game enthusiast on the network 
-Exisitng People in the Web 3 gaming Space 
-Investors 
-Game Studios,Creatives & Artists, 3d modellers, animators, UI developers etc

What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? 

-I have been XPR community members for 2.5 years and have worked toward bringing gaming to the ecosystem in that time. 
-I are driven by providing the best user experience for gamers 
-I have experience across different chains and working and participating in the ecosystems. We see a gap in XPR network market and entire space for gamer orientated gaming. 
-I have worked to create profiles across other ecosystems as buyers, sellers, creators. This can drive new engagement the wider industry.
-I have 2 decades experience of digital asset knowledge from other industries. The use of parametric modelling, NFTS, Smart contracts and advancements in DLT technology will enable us to create games with the XPR network interactions that innovates the digital landscape in many potential ways. There is no gaming infrastructure on the XPR network. We have built a fully functioning digital asset marketplace that will form part of this infrastructure that we will bring online as soon as I can. We want to include the ecosystem in this using both Snipverse and developing tools with the new Blastpad for distribution of digital assets.
